FizzBuzz is a programming workshop for Ruby beginners. You'll learn to solve programming puzzles using the Ruby programming language, and have some fun while doing it.

We'll start with the basics of Ruby, and will then continue to a simple FizzBuzz implementation. We'll keep switching between Ruby fundamentals and programming puzzles until you get a hang of it. (see *Agenda* below).

The goal is to enable you tackle  programming interviews using Ruby, and to also demonstrate the power and elegance of Ruby.
